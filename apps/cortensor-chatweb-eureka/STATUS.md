## üó∫Ô∏è Development Priorities

Here is a high-level overview of our planned features and improvements, organized by priority.

### **Immediate Priorities (Up Next)**
* **UI/UX Polish**: Refine the chat history panel to ensure all UI elements, including the delete button, are consistently visible and functional regardless of title length.
* **Smarter Error Messaging**: Implement more specific user-facing error messages to clearly distinguish between a network timeout and a situation where all miners genuinely provided no response.

### **Next Steps (Coming Soon)**
* **Simplified API Endpoint**: Explore a non-streaming endpoint for chat completions as an alternative to increase reliability in different network conditions.
* **Model Configuration**: Add UI options for users to select different AI models or adjust LLM parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens).
* **Code Refactoring**: Clean up the frontend state management for better maintainability and long-term scalability.

### **Future Goals (Long-Term)**
* **Full Web3 Integration**: Introduce wallet connectivity to allow users to create and manage sessions directly on the blockchain.
* **Multi-User Support**: Explore user authentication for distinct user profiles and private chat histories.
