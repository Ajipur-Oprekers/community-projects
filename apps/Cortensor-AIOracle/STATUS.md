# Project Status

This document outlines the current status and development priorities for **Cortensor AIOracle**

## Roadmap

### Short-Term

* Improve the consensus algorithm for more accurate results.
* Add a wider variety of language models to the selection.
* Enhance the user interface and user experience.
* Implement a more robust error handling system.

### Long-Term

* Develop a public API for programmatic access to the oracle.
* Integrate with a broader range of data sources, including academic papers and real-time news feeds.
* Explore decentralized oracle solutions to further enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of the system.

## Known Issues

* The UI may not be fully responsive on all devices.
* The consensus visualization can be slow to render for complex queries.
* Some models may occasionally fail to generate a response, which can affect the consensus result.
